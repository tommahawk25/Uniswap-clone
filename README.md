My testing clone of Uniswap.

@OpenZeppelin and @Uniswap are too big to upload, so in order for project to be functional you need to install following:
-for workspace core "npm install @openzeppelin/contracts@2.5.1"
-for workspace periphery "npm install @uniswap/lib @uniswap/v2-core"
-for migrator "npm install @openzeppelin/contracts@3.4.1 @uniswap/v2-core"

Periphery migration file (2_deploy_contracts.js) is not fully completed yet.
